# üõ†Ô∏è Software Developer | Neovim enthusiast

Lately, I‚Äôve been writing Go and PHP, tweaking Neovim configs

Currently grinding code, lifting weights, and occasionally touching grass.  

## You might know me from:
- Writing Go & PHP for a living  
- Configuring Neovim instead of actually coding  
- Wondering if I should rewrite everything in C  

## Where to find me:
- **GitHub:** You're already here  
- **Twitter/X:** If I ever decide to post  
- **Email:** Probably in my commits
