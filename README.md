# Hi, I'm Omar Gabriel aka 'biignoisee'
## VILT Developer (Vue • Inertia. js • Laravel • Tailwind)

I build modern, fast, and clean web applications using the **VILT stack**.   
My focus is creating products that feel smooth, load fast, and are structured well enough to scale without turning into spaghetti code.

I've spent the last **3+ years** working as a backend dev (Laravel/PHP), and now I'm doubling down on becoming a **full-on indie hacker** — building on the internet, shipping fast, and helping clients launch products that actually make money.
